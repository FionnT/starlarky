        Uninstall packages.

        pip is able to uninstall most installed packages. Known exceptions are:

        - Pure distutils packages installed with ``python setup.py install``, which
          leave behind no metadata to determine what files were installed.
        - Script wrappers installed by ``python setup.py develop``.
