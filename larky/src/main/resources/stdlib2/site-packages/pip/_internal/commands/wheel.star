        Build Wheel archives for your requirements and dependencies.

        Wheel is a built-package format, and offers the advantage of not
        recompiling your software during every install. For more details, see the
        wheel docs: https://wheel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

        Requirements: setuptools>=0.8, and wheel.

        'pip wheel' uses the bdist_wheel setuptools extension from the wheel
        package to build individual wheels.
