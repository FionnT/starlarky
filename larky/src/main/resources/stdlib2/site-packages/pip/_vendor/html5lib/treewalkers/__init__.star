    Get a TreeWalker class for various types of tree with built-in support

            Supported values are:

            * "dom": The xml.dom.minidom DOM implementation
            * "etree": A generic walker for tree implementations exposing an
              elementtree-like interface (known to work with ElementTree,
              cElementTree and lxml.etree).
            * "lxml": Optimized walker for lxml.etree
            * "genshi": a Genshi stream

        :arg implementation: A module implementing the tree type e.g.
            xml.etree.ElementTree or cElementTree (Currently applies to the "etree"
            tree type only).

        :arg kwargs: keyword arguments passed to the etree walker--for other
            walkers, this has no effect

        :returns: a TreeWalker class
