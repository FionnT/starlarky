def getTreeBuilder(treeType, implementation=None, **kwargs):
    """
    Get a TreeBuilder class for various types of trees with built-in support

        :arg treeType: the name of the tree type required (case-insensitive). Supported
            values are:

            * "dom" - A generic builder for DOM implementations, defaulting to a
              xml.dom.minidom based implementation.
            * "etree" - A generic builder for tree implementations exposing an
              ElementTree-like interface, defaulting to xml.etree.cElementTree if
              available and xml.etree.ElementTree if not.
            * "lxml" - A etree-based builder for lxml.etree, handling limitations
              of lxml's implementation.

        :arg implementation: (Currently applies to the "etree" and "dom" tree
            types). A module implementing the tree type e.g. xml.etree.ElementTree
            or xml.etree.cElementTree.

        :arg kwargs: Any additional options to pass to the TreeBuilder when
            creating it.

        Example:

        >>> from html5lib.treebuilders import getTreeBuilder
        >>> builder = getTreeBuilder('etree')
