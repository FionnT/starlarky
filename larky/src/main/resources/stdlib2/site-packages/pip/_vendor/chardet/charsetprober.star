                We define three types of bytes:
                alphabet: english alphabets [a-zA-Z]
                international: international characters [\x80-\xFF]
                marker: everything else [^a-zA-Z\x80-\xFF]

                The input buffer can be thought to contain a series of words delimited
                by markers. This function works to filter all words that contain at
                least one international character. All contiguous sequences of markers
                are replaced by a single space ascii character.

                This filter applies to all scripts which do not use English characters.

    def filter_with_english_letters(buf):
        """

                Returns a copy of ``buf`` that retains only the sequences of English
                alphabet and high byte characters that are not between <> characters.
                Also retains English alphabet and high byte characters immediately
                before occurrences of >.

                This filter can be applied to all scripts which contain both English
                characters and extended ASCII characters, but is currently only used by
                ``Latin1Prober``.
