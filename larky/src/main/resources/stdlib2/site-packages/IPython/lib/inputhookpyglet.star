    Run the pyglet event loop by processing pending events only.

        This keeps processing pending events until stdin is ready.  After
        processing all pending events, a call to time.sleep is inserted.  This is
        needed, otherwise, CPU usage is at 100%.  This sleep time should be tuned
        though for best performance.
