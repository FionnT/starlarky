        strng can be a mime-bundle dict, supplying multiple representations,
        keyed by mime-type.

        The screen_lines parameter specifies the number of *usable* lines of your
        terminal screen (total lines minus lines you need to reserve to show other
        information).

        If you set screen_lines to a number <=0, page() will try to auto-determine
        your screen size and will only use up to (screen_size+screen_lines) for
        printing, paging after that. That is, if you want auto-detection but need
        to reserve the bottom 3 lines of the screen, use screen_lines = -3, and for
        auto-detection without any lines reserved simply use screen_lines = 0.

        If a string won't fit in the allowed lines, it is sent through the
        specified pager command. If none given, look for PAGER in the environment,
        and ultimately default to less.

        If no system pager works, the string is sent through a 'dumb pager'
        written in python, very simplistic.
