def PromptStripper:

    Remove matching input prompts from a block of input.

        Parameters
        ----------
        prompt_re : regular expression
            A regular expression matching any input prompt (including continuation,
            e.g. ``...``)
        initial_re : regular expression, optional
            A regular expression matching only the initial prompt, but not continuation.
            If no initial expression is given, prompt_re will be used everywhere.
            Used mainly for plain Python prompts (``>>>``), where the continuation prompt
            ``...`` is a valid Python expression in Python 3, so shouldn't be stripped.

        Notes
        -----

        If initial_re and prompt_re differ,
        only initial_re will be tested against the first line.
        If any prompt is found on the first two lines,
        prompts will be stripped from the rest of the block.

    r"""Assemble a single line from multiple continued line pieces

        Continued lines are lines ending in ``\``, and the line following the last
        ``\`` in the block.

        For example, this code continues over multiple lines::

            if (assign_ix is not None) \
                 and (len(line) >= assign_ix + 2) \

                 and (line[assign_ix+2].type == tokenize.NAME):

        This statement contains four continued line pieces.
        Assembling these pieces into a single line would give::

            if (assign_ix is not None) and (len(line) >= assign_ix + 2) and (line[...

        This uses 0-indexed line numbers. *start* is (lineno, colno).

        multiple lines.

def TokenTransformBase:
    """
    Base class for transformations which examine tokens.

        Special syntax should not be transformed when it occurs inside strings or
        comments. This is hard to reliably avoid with regexes. The solution is to
        tokenise the code as Python, and recognise the special syntax in the tokens.

        IPython's special syntax is not valid Python syntax, so tokenising may go
        wrong after the special syntax starts. These classes therefore find and
        transform *one* instance of special syntax at a time into regular Python
        syntax. After each transformation, tokens are regenerated to find the next
        piece of special syntax.

        Subclasses need to implement one class method (find)
        and one regular method (transform).

        The priority attribute can select which transformation to apply if multiple
        transformers match in the same place. Lower numbers have higher priority.
        This allows "%magic?" to be turned into a help call rather than a magic call.
