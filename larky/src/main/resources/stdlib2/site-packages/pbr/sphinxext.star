    Find the 'setup.cfg' file, if it exists.

        This assumes we're using 'doc/source' for documentation, but also allows
        for single level 'doc' paths.

    Return string name of project name, or None.

        This extracts metadata from 'setup.cfg'. We don't rely on
        distutils/setuptools as we don't want to actually install the package
        simply to build docs.
