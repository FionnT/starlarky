def MappedQueue:
    """
    The MappedQueue class implements an efficient minimum heap. The
        smallest element can be popped in O(1) time, new elements can be pushed
        in O(log n) time, and any element can be removed or updated in O(log n)
        time. The queue cannot contain duplicate elements and an attempt to push an
        element already in the queue will have no effect.

        MappedQueue complements the heapq package from the python standard
        library. While MappedQueue is designed for maximum compatibility with
        heapq, it has slightly different functionality.

        Examples
        --------

        A `MappedQueue` can be created empty or optionally given an array of
        initial elements. Calling `push()` will add an element and calling `pop()`
        will remove and return the smallest element.

        >>> q = MappedQueue([916, 50, 4609, 493, 237])
        >>> q.push(1310)
        True
        >>> x = [q.pop() for i in range(len(q.h))]
        >>> x
        [50, 237, 493, 916, 1310, 4609]

        Elements can also be updated or removed from anywhere in the queue.

        >>> q = MappedQueue([916, 50, 4609, 493, 237])
        >>> q.remove(493)
        >>> q.update(237, 1117)
        >>> x = [q.pop() for i in range(len(q.h))]
        >>> x
        [50, 916, 1117, 4609]
