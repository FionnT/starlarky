def reversed(G):
    """
    A context manager for temporarily reversing a directed graph in place.

        This is a no-op for undirected graphs.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : graph
            A NetworkX graph.

        Warning
        -------
        The reversed context manager is deprecated in favor
        of G.reverse(copy=False). The view allows multiple threads to use the
        same graph without confusion while the context manager does not.
        This context manager is scheduled to be removed in version 3.0.
