def karate_club_graph():
    """
    Returns Zachary's Karate Club graph.

        Each node in the returned graph has a node attribute 'club' that
        indicates the name of the club to which the member represented by that node
        belongs, either 'Mr. Hi' or 'Officer'.

        Examples
        --------
        To get the name of the club to which a node belongs::

            >>> G = nx.karate_club_graph()
            >>> G.nodes[5]["club"]
            'Mr. Hi'
            >>> G.nodes[9]["club"]
            'Officer'
