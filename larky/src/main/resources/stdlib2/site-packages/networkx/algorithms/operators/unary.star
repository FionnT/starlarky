def complement(G):
    """
    Returns the graph complement of G.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : graph
           A NetworkX graph

        Returns
        -------
        GC : A new graph.

        Notes
        ------
        Note that complement() does not create self-loops and also
        does not produce parallel edges for MultiGraphs.

        Graph, node, and edge data are not propagated to the new graph.
    
    """
def reverse(G, copy=True):
    """
    Returns the reverse directed graph of G.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : directed graph
            A NetworkX directed graph
        copy : bool
            If True, then a new graph is returned. If False, then the graph is
            reversed in place.

        Returns
        -------
        H : directed graph
            The reversed G.
