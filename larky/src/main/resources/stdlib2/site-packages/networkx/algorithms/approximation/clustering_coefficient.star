def average_clustering(G, trials=1000, seed=None):
    """
    r"""Estimates the average clustering coefficient of G.

        The local clustering of each node in `G` is the fraction of triangles
        that actually exist over all possible triangles in its neighborhood.
        The average clustering coefficient of a graph `G` is the mean of
        local clusterings.

        This function finds an approximate average clustering coefficient
        for G by repeating `n` times (defined in `trials`) the following
        experiment: choose a node at random, choose two of its neighbors
        at random, and check if they are connected. The approximate
        coefficient is the fraction of triangles found over the number
        of trials [1]_.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX graph

        trials : integer
            Number of trials to perform (default 1000).

        seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
            Indicator of random number generation state.
            See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.

        Returns
        -------
        c : float
            Approximated average clustering coefficient.
