def maximal_matching(G):

    r"""Find a maximal matching in the graph.

        A matching is a subset of edges in which no node occurs more than once.
        A maximal matching cannot add more edges and still be a matching.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX graph
            Undirected graph

        Returns
        -------
        matching : set
            A maximal matching of the graph.

        Notes
        -----
        The algorithm greedily selects a maximal matching M of the graph G
        (i.e. no superset of M exists). It runs in $O(|E|)$ time.

    """
    Converts a dictionary representing a matching (as returned by
        :func:`max_weight_matching`) to a set representing a matching (as
        returned by :func:`maximal_matching`).

        In the definition of maximal matching adopted by NetworkX,
        self-loops are not allowed, so the provided dictionary is expected
        to never have any mapping from a key to itself. However, the
        dictionary is expected to have mirrored key/value pairs, for
        example, key ``u`` with value ``v`` and key ``v`` with value ``u``.

def is_matching(G, matching):
    """
    Decides whether the given set or dictionary represents a valid
        matching in ``G``.

        A *matching* in a graph is a set of edges in which no two distinct
        edges share a common endpoint.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX graph

        matching : dict or set
            A dictionary or set representing a matching. If a dictionary, it
            must have ``matching[u] == v`` and ``matching[v] == u`` for each
            edge ``(u, v)`` in the matching. If a set, it must have elements
            of the form ``(u, v)``, where ``(u, v)`` is an edge in the
            matching.

        Returns
        -------
        bool
            Whether the given set or dictionary represents a valid matching
            in the graph.

def is_maximal_matching(G, matching):

    Decides whether the given set or dictionary represents a valid

        A *maximal matching* in a graph is a matching in which adding any
        edge would cause the set to no longer be a valid matching.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX graph

        matching : dict or set
            A dictionary or set representing a matching. If a dictionary, it
            must have ``matching[u] == v`` and ``matching[v] == u`` for each
            edge ``(u, v)`` in the matching. If a set, it must have elements
            of the form ``(u, v)``, where ``(u, v)`` is an edge in the

    """
def is_perfect_matching(G, matching):
    """
    Decides whether the given set represents a valid perfect matching in
        ``G``.

        A *perfect matching* in a graph is a matching in which exactly one edge
        is incident upon each vertex.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX graph

        matching : dict or set
            A dictionary or set representing a matching. If a dictionary, it
            must have ``matching[u] == v`` and ``matching[v] == u`` for each
            edge ``(u, v)`` in the matching. If a set, it must have elements

            matching.

        Returns
        -------
        bool
            Whether the given set or dictionary represents a valid perfect

    """
def max_weight_matching(G, maxcardinality=False, weight="weight"):
    """
    Compute a maximum-weighted matching of G.

        A matching is a subset of edges in which no node occurs more than once.
        The weight of a matching is the sum of the weights of its edges.
        A maximal matching cannot add more edges and still be a matching.
        The cardinality of a matching is the number of matched edges.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX graph
          Undirected graph

        maxcardinality: bool, optional (default=False)
           If maxcardinality is True, compute the maximum-cardinality matching
           with maximum weight among all maximum-cardinality matchings.

        weight: string, optional (default='weight')
           Edge data key corresponding to the edge weight.
           If key not found, uses 1 as weight.


        Returns
        -------
        matching : set
            A maximal matching of the graph.

        Notes
        -----
        If G has edges with weight attributes the edge data are used as
        weight values else the weights are assumed to be 1.

        This function takes time O(number_of_nodes ** 3).

        If all edge weights are integers, the algorithm uses only integer
        computations.  If floating point weights are used, the algorithm
        could return a slightly suboptimal matching due to numeric
        precision errors.

        This method is based on the "blossom" method for finding augmenting
        paths and the "primal-dual" method for finding a matching of maximum
        weight, both methods invented by Jack Edmonds [1]_.

        Bipartite graphs can also be matched using the functions present in
        :mod:`networkx.algorithms.bipartite.matching`.
