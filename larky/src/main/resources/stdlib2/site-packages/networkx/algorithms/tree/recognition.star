def is_arborescence(G):
    """

        Returns True if `G` is an arborescence.

        An arborescence is a directed tree with maximum in-degree equal to 1.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : graph
            The graph to test.

        Returns
        -------
        b : bool
            A boolean that is True if `G` is an arborescence.

        Notes
        -----
        In another convention, an arborescence is known as a *tree*.

    """
def is_branching(G):
    """

        Returns True if `G` is a branching.

        A branching is a directed forest with maximum in-degree equal to 1.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : directed graph
            The directed graph to test.

        Returns
        -------
        b : bool
            A boolean that is True if `G` is a branching.

        Notes
        -----
        In another convention, a branching is also known as a *forest*.

    """
def is_forest(G):
    """

        Returns True if `G` is a forest.

        A forest is a graph with no undirected cycles.

        For directed graphs, `G` is a forest if the underlying graph is a forest.
        The underlying graph is obtained by treating each directed edge as a single
        undirected edge in a multigraph.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : graph
            The graph to test.

        Returns
        -------
        b : bool
            A boolean that is True if `G` is a forest.

        Notes
        -----
        In another convention, a directed forest is known as a *polyforest* and
        then *forest* corresponds to a *branching*.

    """
def is_tree(G):
    """

        Returns True if `G` is a tree.

        A tree is a connected graph with no undirected cycles.

        For directed graphs, `G` is a tree if the underlying graph is a tree. The
        underlying graph is obtained by treating each directed edge as a single
        undirected edge in a multigraph.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : graph
            The graph to test.

        Returns
        -------
        b : bool
            A boolean that is True if `G` is a tree.

        Notes
        -----
        In another convention, a directed tree is known as a *polytree* and then
        *tree* corresponds to an *arborescence*.
