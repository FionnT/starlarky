def moral_graph(G):
    """
    r"""Return the Moral Graph

            Returns the moralized graph of a given directed graph.

            Parameters
            ----------
            G : NetworkX graph
                Directed graph

            Returns
            -------
            H : NetworkX graph
                The undirected moralized graph of G

            Notes
            ------
            A moral graph is an undirected graph H = (V, E) generated from a
            directed Graph, where if a node has more than one parent node, edges
            between these parent nodes are inserted and all directed edges become
            undirected.
