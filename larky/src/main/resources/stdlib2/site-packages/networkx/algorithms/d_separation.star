def d_separated(G: nx.DiGraph, x: AbstractSet, y: AbstractSet, z: AbstractSet) -> bool:
    """

        Return whether node sets ``x`` and ``y`` are d-separated by ``z``.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : graph
            A NetworkX DAG.

        x : set
            First set of nodes in ``G``.

        y : set
            Second set of nodes in ``G``.

        z : set
            Set of conditioning nodes in ``G``. Can be empty set.

        Returns
        -------
        b : bool
            A boolean that is true if ``x`` is d-separated from ``y`` given ``z`` in ``G``.

        Raises
        ------
        NetworkXError
            The *d-separation* test is commonly used with directed
            graphical models which are acyclic.  Accordingly, the algorithm
            raises a :exc:`NetworkXError` if the input graph is not a DAG.

        NodeNotFound
            If any of the input nodes are not found in the graph,
            a :exc:`NodeNotFound` exception is raised.
