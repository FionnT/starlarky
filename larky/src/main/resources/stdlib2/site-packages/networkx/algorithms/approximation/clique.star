def max_clique(G):
    """
    r"""Find the Maximum Clique

        Finds the $O(|V|/(log|V|)^2)$ apx of maximum clique/independent set
        in the worst case.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX graph
            Undirected graph

        Returns
        -------
        clique : set
            The apx-maximum clique of the graph

        Notes
        ------
        A clique in an undirected graph G = (V, E) is a subset of the vertex set
        `C \subseteq V` such that for every two vertices in C there exists an edge
        connecting the two. This is equivalent to saying that the subgraph
        induced by C is complete (in some cases, the term clique may also refer
        to the subgraph).

        A maximum clique is a clique of the largest possible size in a given graph.
        The clique number `\omega(G)` of a graph G is the number of
        vertices in a maximum clique in G. The intersection number of
        G is the smallest number of cliques that together cover all edges of G.

def large_clique_size(G):
    """
    Find the size of a large clique in a graph.

        A *clique* is a subset of nodes in which each pair of nodes is
        adjacent. This function is a heuristic for finding the size of a
        large clique in the graph.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX graph

        Returns
        -------
        int
           The size of a large clique in the graph.

        Notes
        -----
        This implementation is from [1]_. Its worst case time complexity is
        :math:`O(n d^2)`, where *n* is the number of nodes in the graph and
        *d* is the maximum degree.

        This function is a heuristic, which means it may work well in
        practice, but there is no rigorous mathematical guarantee on the
        ratio between the returned number and the actual largest clique size
        in the graph.
