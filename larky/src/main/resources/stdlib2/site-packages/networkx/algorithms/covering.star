def min_edge_cover(G, matching_algorithm=None):
    """
    Returns a set of edges which constitutes
        the minimum edge cover of the graph.

        A smallest edge cover can be found in polynomial time by finding
        a maximum matching and extending it greedily so that all nodes
        are covered.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX graph
            An undirected bipartite graph.

        matching_algorithm : function
            A function that returns a maximum cardinality matching in a
            given bipartite graph. The function must take one input, the
            graph ``G``, and return a dictionary mapping each node to its
            mate. If not specified,
            :func:`~networkx.algorithms.bipartite.matching.hopcroft_karp_matching`
            will be used. Other possibilities include
            :func:`~networkx.algorithms.bipartite.matching.eppstein_matching`,
            or matching algorithms in the
            :mod:`networkx.algorithms.matching` module.

        Returns
        -------
        min_cover : set

            It contains all the edges of minimum edge cover
            in form of tuples. It contains both the edges `(u, v)` and `(v, u)`
            for given nodes `u` and `v` among the edges of minimum edge cover.

        Notes
        -----
        An edge cover of a graph is a set of edges such that every node of
        the graph is incident to at least one edge of the set.
        The minimum edge cover is an edge covering of smallest cardinality.

        Due to its implementation, the worst-case running time of this algorithm
        is bounded by the worst-case running time of the function
        ``matching_algorithm``.

        Minimum edge cover for bipartite graph can also be found using the
        function present in :mod:`networkx.algorithms.bipartite.covering`
    
    """
def is_edge_cover(G, cover):
    """
    Decides whether a set of edges is a valid edge cover of the graph.

        Given a set of edges, whether it is an edge covering can
        be decided if we just check whether all nodes of the graph
        has an edge from the set, incident on it.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX graph
            An undirected bipartite graph.

        cover : set
            Set of edges to be checked.

        Returns
        -------
        bool
            Whether the set of edges is a valid edge cover of the graph.

        Notes
        -----
        An edge cover of a graph is a set of edges such that every node of
        the graph is incident to at least one edge of the set.
