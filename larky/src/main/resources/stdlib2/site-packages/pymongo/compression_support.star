     This only matters when data is a memoryview since
     id(bytes(data)) == id(data) when data is a bytes.
     NOTE: bytes(memoryview) returns the memoryview repr
     in Python 2.7. The right thing to do in 2.7 is call
     memoryview.tobytes(), but we currently only use
     memoryview in Python 3.x.
