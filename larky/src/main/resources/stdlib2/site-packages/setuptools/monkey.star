def _get_mro(cls):
    """

        Returns the bases classes for cls sorted by the MRO.

        Works around an issue on Jython where inspect.getmro will not return all
        base classes if multiple classes share the same name. Instead, this
        function will return a tuple containing the class itself, and the contents
        of cls.__bases__. See https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/1024.
