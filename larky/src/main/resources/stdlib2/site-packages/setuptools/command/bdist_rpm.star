        Override the default bdist_rpm behavior to do the following:

        1. Run egg_info to ensure the name and version are properly calculated.
        2. Always run 'install' using --single-version-externally-managed to
           disable eggs in RPM distributions.
        3. Replace dash with underscore in the version numbers for better RPM
           compatibility.
