def build_clib(orig.build_clib):
    """

        Override the default build_clib behaviour to do the following:

        1. Implement a rudimentary timestamp-based dependency system
           so 'compile()' doesn't run every time.
        2. Add more keys to the 'build_info' dictionary:
            * obj_deps - specify dependencies for each object compiled.
                         this should be a dictionary mapping a key
                         with the source filename to a list of
                         dependencies. Use an empty string for global
                         dependencies.
            * cflags   - specify a list of additional flags to pass to
                         the compiler.
