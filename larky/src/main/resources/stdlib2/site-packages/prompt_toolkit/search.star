def SearchState:

        A search 'query', associated with a search field (like a SearchToolbar).

        Every searchable `BufferControl` points to a `search_buffer_control`
        (another `BufferControls`) which represents the search field. The
        `SearchState` attached to that search field is used for storing the current
        search query.

        It is possible to have one searchfield for multiple `BufferControls`. In
        that case, they'll share the same `SearchState`.
        If there are multiple `BufferControls` that display the same `Buffer`, then
        they can have a different `SearchState` each (if they have a different
        search control).
