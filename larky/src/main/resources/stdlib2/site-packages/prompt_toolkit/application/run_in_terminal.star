def run_in_terminal(

    """

        Run function on the terminal above the current application or prompt.

        What this does is first hiding the prompt, then running this callable
        (which can safely output to the terminal), and then again rendering the
        prompt which causes the output of this function to scroll above the
        prompt.

        ``func`` is supposed to be a synchronous function. If you need an
        asynchronous version of this function, use the ``in_terminal`` context
        manager directly.

        :param func: The callable to execute.
        :param render_cli_done: When True, render the interface in the
                'Done' state first, then execute the function. If False,
                erase the interface first.
        :param in_executor: When True, run in executor. (Use this for long
            blocking functions, when you don't want to block the event loop.)

        :returns: A `Future`.
