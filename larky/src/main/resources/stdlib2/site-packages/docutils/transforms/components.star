        Include or exclude elements which depend on a specific Docutils component.

        For use with `nodes.pending` elements.  A "pending" element's dictionary
        attribute ``details`` must contain the keys "component" and "format".  The
        value of ``details['component']`` must match the type name of the
        component the elements depend on (e.g. "writer").  The value of
        ``details['format']`` is the name of a specific format or context of that
        component (e.g. "html").  If the matching Docutils component supports that
        format or context, the "pending" element is replaced by the contents of
        ``details['nodes']`` (a list of nodes); otherwise, the "pending" element
        is removed.

        For example, the reStructuredText "meta" directive creates a "pending"
        element containing a "meta" element (in ``pending.details['nodes']``).
        Only writers (``pending.details['component'] == 'writer'``) supporting the
        "html" format (``pending.details['format'] == 'html'``) will include the
        "meta" element; it will be deleted from the output of all other writers.
