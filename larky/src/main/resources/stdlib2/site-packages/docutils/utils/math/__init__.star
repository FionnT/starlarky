    Return the right math environment to display `code`.

        The test simply looks for line-breaks (``\\``) outside environments.
        Multi-line formulae are set with ``align``, one-liners with
        ``equation``.

        If `numbered` evaluates to ``False``, the "starred" versions are used
        to suppress numbering.
