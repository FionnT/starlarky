def match_chars(c1, c2):
    """
    Test whether `c1` and `c2` are a matching open/close character pair.

        Matching open/close pairs are at the same position in
        `punctuation_chars.openers` and `punctuation_chars.closers`.
        The pairing of open/close quotes is ambiguous due to  different
        typographic conventions in different languages,
        so we test for additional matches stored in `quote_pairs`.
