        Table of contents.

        The table of contents is generated in two passes: initial parse and
        transform.  During the initial parse, a 'pending' element is generated
        which acts as a placeholder, storing the TOC title and any options
        internally.  At a later stage in the processing, the 'pending' element is
        replaced by a 'topic' element, a title and the table of contents proper.
