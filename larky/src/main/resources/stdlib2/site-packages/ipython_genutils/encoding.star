    Return the given stream's encoding or a default.

        There are cases where ``sys.std*`` might not actually be a stream, so
        check for the encoding attribute prior to returning it, and return
        a default if it doesn't exist or evaluates as False. ``default``
        is None if not provided.

def getdefaultencoding(prefer_stream=True):

    Return IPython's guess for the default encoding for bytes as text.
    
        If prefer_stream is True (default), asks for stdin.encoding first,
        to match the calling Terminal, but that is often None for subprocesses.
    
        Then fall back on locale.getpreferredencoding(),
        which should be a sensible platform default (that respects LANG environment),
        and finally to sys.getdefaultencoding() which is the most conservative option,
        and usually ASCII on Python 2 or UTF8 on Python 3.
