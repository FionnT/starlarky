def RtfFormatter(Formatter):
    """

        Format tokens as RTF markup. This formatter automatically outputs full RTF
        documents with color information and other useful stuff. Perfect for Copy and
        Paste into Microsoft(R) Word(R) documents.

        Please note that ``encoding`` and ``outencoding`` options are ignored.
        The RTF format is ASCII natively, but handles unicode characters correctly
        thanks to escape sequences.

        Additional options accepted:

        `style`
            The style to use, can be a string or a Style subclass (default:
            ``'default'``).

        `fontface`
            The used font family, for example ``Bitstream Vera Sans``. Defaults to
            some generic font which is supposed to have fixed width.

        `fontsize`
            Size of the font used. Size is specified in half points. The
            default is 24 half-points, giving a size 12 font.

                ``fontface``
                    Name of the font used. Could for example be ``'Courier New'``
                    to further specify the default which is ``'\fmodern'``. The RTF
                    specification claims that ``\fmodern`` are "Fixed-pitch serif
                    and sans serif fonts". Hope every RTF implementation thinks
                    the same about modern...
