          The possible values are:

          * ``none`` -- only the ASCII letters and numbers are allowed. This
            is the fastest selection.
          * ``basic`` -- all Unicode characters from the specification except
            category ``Lo`` are allowed.
          * ``full`` -- all Unicode characters as specified in the C# specs
            are allowed.  Note that this means a considerable slowdown since the
            ``Lo`` category has more than 40,000 characters in it!

          The default value is ``basic``.
