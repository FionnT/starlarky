        The source of the primary tool that reads such specifications is available
        at https://github.com/seL4/capdl/tree/master/capDL-tool. Note that this
        lexer only supports a subset of the grammar. For example, identifiers can
        shadow type names, but these instances are currently incorrectly
        highlighted as types. Supporting this would need a stateful lexer that is
        considered unnecessarily complex for now.
